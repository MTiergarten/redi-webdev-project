## âœ… Phase 1 | _due 13/05_ (working output with limited flexibility)
- User selects intolerances, allergies or preferences (e.g. don't recommend peanuts / gluten)
  - [x] ~~To do: form to select intolerances~~
- App fetches recipes from local database based on user preferences (while no API)
  - [x] ~~To do: Create hardcoded recipe database for testing (while no API)~~
  - [x] ~~To do: DOM manipulation - extract user preferences from the form~~
  - [x] ~~To do: filter recipes by ingredients~~
- App generates a 1-week meal plan (e.g. 2 options for each meal (breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner), reused across the week)
  - [x] ~~To do: return plan with randomized recipes to yield enough meals for a week~~

## ðŸ’­ Wishlist of future improvements
- Button to clear filter selection
- Visual: "Finding recipes..." (short delay with animation)
- Show calories and macros for each portion
- Allow user to add their own recipes
- Allow user to customize portion size (maybe according to calories / macro goals?)
- Import recipes from links (eg recipe blogs)
- Rating recipes: suggest more/less/nothing of a given recipe
- Allow users to save recipes in a collection (consider Window:local storage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage ?)
- Save user preferences to create a new plan, based on a rotation of liked and saved recipes
- Allow user to customize plan (maybe similar to https://coolors.co/)
- Import plans/recipes from dietitians
- Allow to filter by level of difficulty
- Suggestions: a recipe you might like for the weekend
- More personalization:
  - Let user select preferred ingredient for a meal
  - Let user define a meal plan structure selecting n meals/day, n days, n times they want to cook 
  - Let user pick how many ideas they want per meal (counter 1 to 7)
  - Let use toggle meals on/off (eg only lunch and dinner)
